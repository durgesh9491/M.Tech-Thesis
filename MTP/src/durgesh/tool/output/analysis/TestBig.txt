the 21st century is indeed the best time to live this is because it is filled with innovations in the fields of technology and science that have transformed the way human beings live it is not only easier but also faster to carry out certain tasks such as typing or sending information from one place to another bridgetts 121 moreover the mortality rate has significantly reduced thanks to advancements in the fields of medicine this paper discusses why it is better to live in the present time by showing its pros and cons today people have less fear of contagious diseases because of the advancements in the medical field bridgetts 122 human beings are longer vulnerable to diseases such as tuberculosis and cholera vaccination programs launched in schools hospitals and churches have helped keep these diseases at bay in addition it is possible to carry out surgeries that were initially deemed impossible for example persons with heart related problems can undergo operations to replace them and continue to live a healthy life bridgetts 122 individuals with clogged blood vessels i e arteries can undergo operations for them to be removed and replaced with unclogged arteries thus providing an alternative pathway for the flow of blood jinglong 145 any growth that may be detrimental to a person s health can today be removed by the use of lasers this clearly shows why the 21st century is indeed the best time to live on earth bridgetts 123 it is much easier to move from one place to another than it was in the past journeys that took days today take a few hours for example the invention of the electric train has shorted the travel time between states by more than half bridgetts 123 this implies that people can move to different places within a short time interval furthermore it has enabled the transportation of perishable goods such as flowers and fruits across continents thus promoting economic development of the exporting countries lives and practices in the 21st century are environmentally friendly initially it was difficult to dispose of waste material due to its nature plastics and other non biodegradable materials polluted the environment as they could not decompose the evolution of technology has led to the invention and innovation of new ways of recycling these materials plastic bottles and containers can be regenerated from other forms of plastic thus promoting environmental conservation in addition there is increased used of other alternative sources of energy such as the fuel cell and biogas which are not only environmentally friendly but can also generate twice the amount of energy bridgetts 124 advancements in the communications sector have helped improve communication and interaction between people in various parts of the world the internet and other social media avenues such as twitter facebook and linkedin have enabled people to communicate with the touch of a button bridgetts 126 the issue of

on the facebook page of the company similarly companies and businesses can also keep their clients up to speed with the goods in stock initially companies used newspapers and billboards to reach out to their clients dublin institute of technology 15 this clearly shows how technological advancements have revolutionized the way human beings carry out their day to day activities in the 21st century it is possible to preserve food and other products that were initially going to waste due to lack of proper storage facilities fruits and vegetables can today last for as long as a month thanks to the invention of refrigeration techniques this allows the purchase of large volumes of goods thus cutting on costs dublin institute of technology 18 in addition it is possible to create a wide range of products for processing these fruits and vegetables such advancements promote healthy nutrition thus safeguarding the health and well being of humans life in the 21st century is filled with love peace and harmony individuals in the society today have embraced gender equality in all aspects of life initially the male child was favored over the female child this resulted in torture and oppression of women in the current world men and women are judged based on their qualifications dublin institute of technology 13 there is zero segregation in the employment and education sectors these are clear illustrations of why the 21st century is the best time to live on the contrary these technological advancements have led to various calamities that have negatively affected the quality of life today excessive use of fossil fuels has promoted the degradation of the environment sulfur nitrogen and carbon oxide emissions have led to the depletion of the ozone layer leading to global warming various parts of the world are experiencing climatic change because of this dublin institute of technology 98 in countries such as china people walk with gas masks due to high pollution levels of the atmosphere technological advancements have also increased cybercrime and terrorism criminals use computers to launch attacks in various parts of the world moreover criminals hack into banking systems and other financial institutions using the internet countries lose billions of shillings trying to trace where their finances have gone this clearly shows the why life in the present day is not as good as it may seem in conclusion it is evident that the present time is the ideal time to live technological advancements in the current 21st century have helped improve the wellbeing of human beings it is difficult for an individual to suffer from ailments such as tuberculosis and cholera as vaccines have been invented to curb such ailments moreover it is possible for one to communicate with the other thanks to the internet and social media avenues perishable goods and products can be transported to distant places without risk of them going bad this would not have been possible in the past as the means of transport then were slow and lacked preservation mechanisms such as refrigerators energy is today harnessed from the sun wind and fuel cell reducing dependence on fossil fuels that promote environmental degradation measures have been enacted to help curb terrorism and cybercrime companies and security firms have created firewalls that cannot be easily broken by thieves and unscrupulous persons those who lived in the past missed a lot of things ranging from advanced medication and improved education since humans began to interact with animals they have always been fascinated by them the animals give al they live with there instincts and there way of living if we see a animal that i hurt we want to help and if one come up to you and look at you with there eyes that say i am hungry how can you not help them the way of using animals for tourist have been going on for many years people having elephants that can do trick and monkeys that you can hold humans toke animals in to circuses and showed them of so that we could see that they were not that dangerous so when humans al over the world got use to having animals in animals parks or at the circuses they need more so to interact with animals in the wild was the next step to have a photo of you feeding a cut koala or petting a tiger that is were the wild life tourism is to day with live interactions the reason that it is big and that people want to do this thing is because over history with animals make us want to do things with them animals is a very good attraction reynolds and brathwaite 2001 the travelling circuses knotweed that 100 of years ago and it still works have a interesting animal and people come for it the easiest to show this is to think about what symbols is used with big companies to marketing there products for example the panda for wwf and the bull for red bull the cut panda that everyone associate with helping the planet and a bull that make you think that drinking it makes you strong as a bull the negative effect wildlife tourism have on animals are the effects of feeding animals cars in parking lots that might injury or kill animals and habitat changes the positive effect is when the wildlife interactions are under proper supervision there will be a financial contribution and also education to the tourist and the people helping so to see why this effect are fighter negative or positive lets look deeper on the different aspects the wildlife tourisms biggest problem is when the animals get to used to being around people when the peoples point with the trip is to get as close as possible and in many cases to feed the animals orams 1996 what tourist do when they feed wild animals is that they changes there natural behaviors and then the future for the animals marint and r eale 2007 what happens is that the young animals next generations learn from the beginning that humans give food the adult animals will not teach the young ones how to find there oven food and they will relay on humans so what happens when one animals attack for food and the managers forbid al feeding how can the animals then find food if humans stop feeding them is this really the way we want the wild animals to behave do we want them to be pets as well to have all the animals obeying the human as already stated one problem with feeding animals is that they can become aggressive if they don t get enough food or that more dangerous animals come in to camping ground to find food from trashcans and in the peoples tenths and caravans the one that suffer from this is not the humans it is the animals they can get bad food they way to handle the animals that don t fit in to the standards set by humans is to take them away ether by relocate them or to put them to sleep humans have change the nature and are saying that the nature have to follow the changes an other thing that can happen is that the animals get direct injury or death by cars green and higginbottom 2000 that animals at parking lots that have gotten used to get food at cars will go up to the cars and them and get hit by them wallabies on cradle mountain national park in tasmania skira and smith 1991 this is a big impact since in most cases the animals die what can be done is that if it used to be a popular area to feed the animals to put up signs so that the new tourist know that they are not allowed to feed the animals also to show them that there are wild animals in the area so the look where they are going it is hard to see behind the car but if the people are more aware of the animals they might not miss them but humans don t only accidental kill the animals they also interfering and go in to the animals habitats that disturbs the animals behavior and inducing more stress in to there normal life green and higginbottom 2000 there have been a lot of studys made that proves that when the animals here human get photo taken of them and have cars stop close there stress levels get higher so they then spend more energy on moving away from humans instead on their growth or reproduction shaughnessy et al 2008 and courbis 2007 the main impact that humans have on animals when it comes to interfering is changing their habitat that can happens in many of ways one is to make the environment more friendly to humans like putting in walking or driving roads roads this is bad because if many humans walk on the road the animals will move away to be left alone then the new road have to be made to get to then animals the problem when not bilding walking tracks is that the tourist will walk to the animals the way they can so it can be the fast or the one that everyone els walks it will still be a big impact ether way because if people walk their oven way more of the habitat will be affected but with walking tracks normal paths for the animals can be cut off the effect that new drive roads can have is that people can get to the animals essayer that will give higher speed on the cars and busses more road kills and more contamination of gases from the cars it will also give a higer presur on the location that it can handle more people like car parks and trash caring the biggest problem when people are coming in to the animals habitat is that they want to go beyond the barriers so the fact that in national parks the guides are not well paid so they will break the law of the park if the visitor bribes them with money sekhar 2003 this often happens so the tourist can go closer to the animals and that disturbs the animals more the way to stop this is to pay the guides more and educate them so the know why it is bad for the animals even draw the parallel to that if the animals get disturb to much they might move away and the guide can loss their small income one other problem that the wild life industry have is to measure the impact that the animals get more street by human presents is a fact courbis 2007 and shaughnessy et al 2008 but that is the only way of measuring it there are still animals that will come closer to the people to get food one way of dealing with this is to use the precautionary principle this is a principle that implies that there is a responsibility to protect the humans from exposure to harm where scientific investigation discovers a possible risk matthee vermersch 2000 and orams 2002 so the principle is to be carefully when in this case staring a wildlife tourism is it known that animals can attack and injury them self or and the people so to work with wild animals there need to be some precaution to protect both the animals and the humans this principle is use not only by wildlife tourism but in every way it is needed one thing that management and evolution of the al tourism have given is wisdom so that humans don t keep on doing the same mistake over and over again as said by reynolds p braithwaite d 2001 that the problem with the precautionary principle it that people operation after the precautionary principle where not understood by the people coming to see the animals and when the recognition with that it is the best way of managing something is gone the managing falls the positive effects are fewer then the negative one but that makes them no less important since it is them that will help the wildlife tourisms the financial help is the major factor that keeps the wildlife tourism working the entry fees and guide tours contribute to some of the conservation for the animals and there habitat that the tourist se that the money goes back to protect the animals and also to the people that work to help them the problem is often that the rangers and other people working don t see the money since it goes in to the government and then back to the parks so they can t see how the fees are contributing to their work wish would be a reason why it is easy to bribe some of them the fact that the workers are not well paid is a reason that they are easy to bride as said above what to do about that it is hard to change how money gets distributed the reason that there is protections is for the animals so the money should go to them but when the one that should follow the rules to protect the animals break them because of money maybe more of the money should go to them so they will protect the animals better there can always be a debate on were the money should be spend but in the end money will be a good help to help the tourism industry to work for example when tourist pays to go out on boats to see whales or to dive at protected places there is a extra fee to pay that money goes back to the mangier that will keep the protection and be able to see that the industry is interact in with the animals the right way the other positive effect that the tourism industries have is education to give to the visitors so that they know how they are helping the animals and can be spread the knowledge s around there is no better way to spread something then to from mouth to mouth education will also make the people to see that it is a wild animals and not a pet that the wild animals should live like they are not to be petted or feed if people want to feed wild animals they should go to animal parks not in to the wild where the animals later will be the one suffering so to educate everyone the rangers park workers and the tourist is the best way to get more people aware of the problem that can occur with wild animals when looking at the effect that tourist have on the wild life it looks like the negative is more and have a bigger effect on the outcome then the positive that is not the entire truth and the reason for that is the money tourism is one of the most money making industry the tourism brings a lot of money in to the governments and have a huge impact on countries economy so to have a tourism that draw people is important as said above animal is a good way to market your product and have always fascinated humans so to have a big wildlife tourism is important for the economy of the world so to stop is not the way to go but to have it sustainable and a good managing plan is important a lot of the negative effects have been pointed out above to be solved by relocating the animals or killing them this is not a good method why should the animal suffer when the humans change the natural way of things the people were the ones going in to the forest giving animals food or leving food scraps behind the people are the ones that are changing everything in the first place and then we blame the animals for it so to solve this good managing need to be dune to help the animals live in there habitat as they are mean to live to stop humans from changing the environment for the animals and then blaming them for not adapting reynolds and brathwaite 2001 said that controlling the encounters it the best way and that leads back to the management and that they have to solve the problem that humans started by feeding and wanting to get close to wild animals one thing that have been mentions above is management that to have a wildlife interaction the management have to be good but what can they do looking at the negative effects that wildlife tourism can have there is a lot to be work on that is not the case most of the negative effects have been work in since the where detected speed limits on road were wild animals might be present or fence put up and special animal rout to get a cross have been made in most place were animals still get feed by humans they have restricted the amount of food that will be distributed so they animals still need to find food some were else also what cinner and aswani 2007 did was to get the local people to be involved to conserve there recourses if the people living in the area and the tourist know the problem a lot of the problem is not there to begin with so the education that is there is a fine managing plan if the tourist know more before they get to the animals they will be lest likely to do the stupid things like petting a wild animal so good management is the key to success with the management the education of people comes to be one of the best example on this is how people that where living on collection souvenirs of the animals for tourist like getting sea horses from the sea or hunting gorillas to trade with their meat got educated and told that they where destroying their lively hood that go them thinking and with help they instead focused on protection there resource and get more tourist to come and see it instead of selling it of and losing it al in the end the key point to see in this is that when it comes down to the wild life industry the people working with it and the tourist coming to enjoy it is that first word wild the reason people go in boat out to see and interact with whales or in to the jungle to see giant pandas guangming 2008 is to see and be with them in there natural habitat one more thing to point out is natural what happened a lot in the beginning with the interactions between humans and animals where that humans tried to change the natural way of things the nature where here before humans and will be here after humans if people don t destroy it before they are gone there are some problems that make interactions with wild animals both hard and dangerous one is that wildlife tourism is having a lot of different components in it so management is hard as talk above that tying to us the precautionary principle is good but it needs to be shown of in a good way with education we should not be able to feed or pet animals to keep the wild when people accept that the conservation can be done in a bigger scale the management are of the wild life tourism is what is helping the animals the most since to protect them from being souvenirs or in captivity keep them alive and in the wild humans are trying to restore what have been lost and help the animals and even though to leave the animals alone to be wild might be the best for the animals the money and educations that the wildlife tourism gives back to humans is what will save the industry and the animals in the end domestic violence or abuse occurs when one a partner ex partner or a family member tries to physically emotionally or sexually dominate the other buzawa 2002 domestic abuse has been happening around the world and the united nation through a research found out that there is a correlation between the poor performing economies and women's discrimination countries that have high rate of women violation incur very high costs that are detrimental to their economies and therefore all governments should aim at reducing the rate of sexual violation and other discrimination that women undergo living conditions of women have been improving since the year 1994 when 179 governments met in egypt and decided to improve women living conditions stan bernstein a senior researcher said that they are still many cases of women discrimination around the world that constitute to grave human rights violations and therefore we should all try to eradicate this in our society as this would improve our economies according to a report titled state of the world population 2000 it is claimed that 1 increase in the number of women attending secondary school it would lead to an increase of 0 3 of the country's economy if for example the pakistani government increased its education budget by only a small percentage this would translate in to an economic growth worth 262 million the report shows bleak statistics about women abuse one out of three women is abused and in most cases by people that they know sexual abuse results to deaths stillbirths unwanted pregnancies and abortions that are committed to get rid of the unplanned child more than 80 million children are not planned for women all over the world fear discussing family planning methods and ways of having protected sex with their husbands for fear of being physically abused this has resulted to increase in hiv aids leading to poor economies the report suggests that governments should do more to change these scenarios some remedial measures planned are banning female genital mutilation the sale of low dosage oral contraceptives adding in the constitution laws that govern sexual and reproductive rights and gender equality of all women if all this are embraced by all the countries of the world then women violence would be reduced or even eliminated this literature review will focus on the scope of parent s education and how it relates and effects to their child s education next it will focus on the factors that contribute to seton hall students whom have parents or a parent with a degree in hopes to obtaining their own degree lastly this literature review will examine the possible outcomes of seton hall students whom have parents or a parent with a college degree the period covered by this review will be within the most recent five years education is knowledge that is obtained or skills that are obtained or developed through a learning process education is ongoing the free dictionary 2014 higher education is at the secondary level of education which could come from a college or university the free dictionary 2014 the scope of parent s education and how it relates and effects their child s education has been a topic studied by numerous researchers the overall topics looked at were how higher educated parents are more likely to have higher educated children researchers have stated that higher educated parents typically make more income which in turn can help with tutors private schooling etc also how higher educated parents are more likely to help their children with the college application process and tough questions about school in general that uneducated parents would struggle with this paper also proves how children are more likely to follow in their parents footsteps so if their parent has a college degree they will more likely try to obtain a college degree the overall findings on this research topic are how there is a positive correlation between parent education and children education the world has really transformed in terms of technology technology is the only thing that changes at a very fast rate every day we wake up to a new innovation of technology and ideas technology through internet has managed to bring the world together in terms of communication despite the varying time zones in different parts of the world internet has paved way for social networks that are turning be a vital field for advertising and creating awareness among people the internet is a branch of technology where there is loads of traffic internet has now become a necessity and has managed to globalize the universe and make it as a small village where people interact freely despite the location and time of the specific region it has as well given rise to several social networks that allow people to stay connected and in touch at any time of their convenience some of the well known social networks include twitter instagram and facebook these social platforms have allowed business people to advertise their companies as well as the products being marketed this research paper will focus on how instagram has managed to make people more sociable the previous notion was that social networks are responsible of making people lonely and create an ambience of loneliness it will shade more light on how instagram brings people s social life into one stage where each and every individual is required to register an account with so as to be given the unique credentials for logging in and interact with other subscribers businesses are now turning to social medias to advertise and promote their sales this is because of the ever increasing social traffic which is always present regardless of the time or the place of business instagram has remarkable improved social exposure and this research paper will conclude on its importance based on purely facts and figures the research topic that this paper is going to investigate in detail is whether instagram as a social network has managed to make people more sociable rather than lonely my stand on the above argument is that i personally believe and completely agree to the fact that instagram has truly managed to make people more social as compared to before the beginning of social networks in order to second my stand in opinion we will use a demonstrative example trying to campaign for an election contestant who is vying for an elective sit this will put us in a position able to compare the different forms of campaign and establish the one which managed to reach the most number of people for my research i will employ instagram as one of the trending social networks to establish whether it is making people to be more social rather than lonely before putting keen emphasize to the example above we can simply ask ourselves as to why businesses are also targeting the social population as a potential field for advertisement this is just a way of proving that instagram one of the social networks has made people more sociable and has improved communications loneliness on the other hand can be defined as being isolated from the other members of the population and still not in a position to keep in touch with them a lonely person is one who cannot keep in touch and communicate with others at free will how can instagram promote loneliness from our definition of the word itself instagram has managed to allow people keep in touch hence my support for the research topic social network has been essential in changing the internet from a space widely known for broadcast of information or transmission to a place where users are involved in creating and generating their own personal content this ranges from short films on you tube to facebook updates this is then followed by the process of signposting their networks to the other contents created by other users beer 2008 thelwell 2009 for literature purposes there is a very clear attention on the extent to which social media has become transformative through the way that users keep in touch with one another evidences from several sources around that could be found with less difficulty show that campaigning and influencing is the most effectively done activity through people s already existing social relationships alinsky 1971 freire 1970 despite the fact that all social media platforms play a major role in this there is a general sense in which social networks have increasingly become powerful the masses that can be reached within a given short period of time via social networks are overwhelming one post with no duplicate of exactly the same information can be viewed and followed by thousands if not millions at a blink of a second most of the already existing social networks were initially established on the basis of a more tailored proposition rather than merely creating an online space where people with common interest could interact freely my space for instance is a social network which was initially started with the sole purpose of enabling aspiring music artistes to share and publicize their own piece of work with other likeminded people among the society pace 2006 facebook started as a mere service for students in a u s university which gradually broadened their service to other non u s universities and this is even before making the platform accessible to everybody kirkpatrick 2010 this is how social networks simply start and end up being a populated platform with millions of users all over the world social network sites provide new audience for civic engagement and for political participation this facilitates information sharing and brings together networks through actions such as utilizing email networking practices and user generated content montgomery 2007 vromen 2007 2008 research studies in saudi arabia have shown that 38 of 17 19 year olds employ social networks instagram for both political and civic engagement smith et al 2009 political leaders are using instagram to post images of peace that advocate for peaceful coexistence the many followers the politician has in instagram media platform will be able to see what their leader is promoting and even leave a comment if they wish to moreover the followers can get the images from the politician s profile and put it as their own so as to spread the message this is just a simple example of how instagram has enabled leaders in saudi arabia to campaign within a short period of time for the young generation who do not think through their participation in either civic or issue based functions as political in the institution or traditional sense social networks are used to connect the individuals who have similar interests about their own projects collin 2010 young people are coming up with new participatory communities which are by and for their peers harris 2008 489 boyd 2007 13 14 in addition services and organizations are increasingly observing social networking practices as the succeeding step towards youth participation in community and government decision making collin 2010 despite the fact that there are still queries as to the extent to which social networks function as virtual public spheres fostering deliberation and enabling direct participation vromen 2008 however the network for communicating information and numerous point of view public sphere permits the recognition of creative digital expression through the social networks as civic engagement burgess et al 2006 there is a vast body of academic work on social networks and technology at large which take into consideration the creative performativity and participatory dimensions of the current digital practices the general usage of social media can simply be described as the collective media creation and sharing on a legitimately large scale this includes social network services as well as other participatory activities like news blogs the rapid up take of both social media and social network services by the young people indicate a very important shift in young generation s use if internet mainly for information and entertainment as one way of communication the young generation is made of producers who actively produce as well as consume media bruns 2008 the participatory media ambience enables the young to take part in creative content production this also empowers them with brand new means of creating as well as sustaining connections among themselves as a result social network platforms have resulted into new discussions on how to conceptualize and advocate for what has come to be termed as cyber citizenship as mentioned earlier on in this research paper i will use a politician social network campaign program via instagram to establish the power of the social platform in terms of moving masses within a short period of time i will visit colleges and higher institutions of learning and promote students to register accounts with instagram this on the other hand will simplify my work because i expect only few students if any who will not be having accounts with instagram i will then advise all the students to follow the politian s account so that they can be able to be informed about the politian updates in his process of campaigning i will collect my data for analysis by counting the number of likes and dislikes for each and every update the politician makes the number of likes will give me a rough idea before the actual data analysis whether the social platform is in support with the campaign trend or not reading through the comments left behind by the followers will help me to conclude the factual side of support or critic from the public the advantage of this methodology is that it comes at no extra cost to the students since opening an instagram account is predominantly free and there is free access to internet services in campuses i will collect all the data throughout the campaign period and code it statistically and appropriately while observing all the statistical hypotheses in collaboration with the election contestant i will pose some questions that call for discussions among the respondents students on instagram this will create a thread of comments and opinions from the online traffic generated i will then read through each individual comment and take it as the opinion from the respective person depending on the number of opinions and comments that i will get i will decide on picking a representative sample of the entire online instagram traffic this sample will be free from biasness and will be selected using a statistical formula called fishers et al i will base on factors such as age gender and level of education to ensure that i come up with a good representative sample of the entire school instagram accounts i will employ systematic random sampling technique to allocate my sample this will be because of some factors that i find necessary to be observed these factors will ensure that the selected sample is a true representation of the population at large and inferences drawn from it will be descriptive and informative about the population i will ensure accuracy of the data by designing self explanatory research questions that can be easily answered by the online instagram users i will analyze the data using one of the statistical software s namely s p s s statistical package for social scientists i will compare the levels of campaign awareness from different medias of communication with the sample data i will get these other medias of communications can be via bill boards advertising television news and radio to get information on previous voting exercises i will go through secondary data and reports that are available in file i will analyze the data through diagrams such as pie charts bar graphs and line graphs
