the means of transport then were slow and lacked preservation mechanisms such as refrigerators energy is today harnessed from the sun wind and fuel cell reducing dependence on fossil fuels that promote environmental degradation measures have been enacted to help curb terrorism and cybercrime companies and security firms have created firewalls that cannot be easily broken by thieves and unscrupulous persons those who lived in the past missed a lot of things ranging from advanced medication and improved education since humans began to interact with animals they have always been fascinated by them the animals give al they live with there instincts and there way of living if we see a animal that i hurt we want to help and if one come up to you and look at you with there eyes that say i am hungry how can you not help them the way of using animals for tourist have been going on for many years people having elephants that can do trick and monkeys that you can hold humans toke animals in to circuses and showed them of so that we could see that they were not that dangerous so when humans al over the world got use to having animals in animals parks or at the circuses they need more so to interact with animals in the wild was the next step to have a photo of you feeding a cut koala or petting a tiger that is were the wild life tourism is to day with live interactions the reason that it is big and that people want to do this thing is because over history with animals make us want to do things with them animals is a very good attraction reynolds and brathwaite 2001 the travelling circuses knotweed that 100 of years ago and it still works have a interesting animal and people come for it the easiest to show this is to think about what symbols is used with big companies to marketing there products for example the panda for wwf and the bull for red bull the cut panda that everyone associate with helping the planet and a bull that make you think that drinking it makes you strong as a bull the negative effect wildlife tourism have on animals are the effects of feeding animals cars in parking lots that might injury or kill animals and habitat changes the positive effect is when the wildlife interactions are under proper supervision there will be a financial contribution and also education to the tourist and the people helping so to see why this effect are fighter negative or positive lets look deeper on the different aspects the wildlife tourisms biggest problem is when the animals get to used to being around people when the peoples point with the trip is to get as close as possible and in many cases to feed the animals orams 1996 what tourist do when they feed wild animals is that they changes there natural behaviors and then the future for the animals marint and r eale 2007 what happens is that the young animals next generations learn from the beginning that humans give food the adult animals will not teach the young ones how to find there oven food and they will relay on humans so what happens when one animals attack for food and the managers forbid al feeding how can the animals then find food if humans stop feeding them is this really the way we want the wild animals to behave do we want them to be pets as well to have all the animals obeying the human as already stated one problem with feeding animals is that they can become aggressive if they don t get enough food or that more dangerous animals come in to camping ground to find food from trashcans and in the peoples tenths and caravans the one that suffer from this is not the humans it is the animals they can get bad food they way to handle the animals that don t fit in to the standards set by humans is to take them away ether by relocate them or to put them to sleep humans have change the nature and are saying that the nature have to follow the changes an other thing that can happen is that the animals get direct injury or death by cars green and higginbottom 2000 that animals at parking lots that have gotten used to get food at cars will go up to the cars and them and get hit by them wallabies on cradle mountain national park in tasmania skira and smith 1991 this is a big impact since in most cases the animals die what can be done is that if it used to be a popular area to feed the animals to put up signs so that the new tourist know that they are not allowed to feed the animals also to show them that there are wild animals in the area so the look where they are going it is hard to see behind the car but if the people are more aware of the animals they might not miss them but humans don t only accidental kill the animals they also interfering and go in to the animals habitats that disturbs the animals behavior and inducing more stress in to there normal life green and higginbottom 2000 there have been a lot of studys made that proves that when the animals here human get photo taken of them and have cars stop close there stress levels get higher so they then spend more energy on moving away from humans instead on their growth or reproduction shaughnessy et al 2008 and courbis 2007 the main impact that humans have on animals when it comes to interfering is changing their habitat that can happens in many of ways one is to make the environment more friendly to humans like putting in walking or driving roads roads this is bad because if many humans walk on the road the animals will move away to be left alone then the new road have to be made to get to then animals the problem when not bilding walking tracks is that the tourist will walk to the animals the way they can so it can be the fast or the one that everyone els walks it will still be a big impact ether way because if people walk their oven way more of the habitat will be affected but with walking tracks normal paths for the animals can be cut off the effect that new drive roads can have is that people can get to the animals essayer that will give higher speed on the cars and busses more road kills and more contamination of gases from the cars it will also give a higer presur on the location that it can handle more people like car parks and trash caring the biggest problem when people are coming in to the animals habitat is that they want to go beyond the barriers so the fact that in national parks the guides are not well paid so they will break the law of the park if the visitor bribes them with money sekhar 2003 this often happens so the tourist can go closer to the animals and that disturbs the animals more the way to stop this is to pay the guides more and educate them so the know why it is bad for the animals even draw the parallel to that if the animals get disturb to much they might move away and the guide can loss their small income one other problem that the wild life industry have is to measure the impact that the animals get more street by human presents is a fact courbis 2007 and shaughnessy et al 2008 but that is the only way of measuring it there are still animals that will come closer to the people to get food one way of dealing with this is to use the precautionary principle this is a principle that implies that there is a responsibility to protect the humans from exposure to harm where scientific investigation discovers a possible risk matthee vermersch 2000 and orams 2002 so the principle is to be carefully when in this case staring a wildlife tourism is it known that animals can attack and injury them self or and the people so to work with wild animals there need to be some precaution to protect both the animals and the humans this principle is use not only by wildlife tourism but in every way it is needed one thing that management and evolution of the al tourism have given is wisdom so that humans don t keep on doing the same mistake over and over again as said by reynolds p braithwaite d 2001 that the problem with the precautionary principle it that people operation after the precautionary principle where not understood by the people coming to see the animals and when the recognition with that it is the best way of managing something is gone the managing falls the positive effects are fewer then the negative one but that makes them no less important
